My list of great C++ libraries

Even bigger list curated here https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp

fmt - https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt
    Uses python style print and formatting library
    like printf & co, but with type checking and more ergonomic 
    is currently being standardized, so look forward to it in the future

json - https://github.com/nlohmann/json
    easy to use & efficient json handling library for C++

rapid-json - https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson
    very fast json library
    my opinion that json shouldn't be your bottleneck, but its whatevs

stb-image - https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h
    easy to use image loading library
    supports several formats   

GLFW - https://github.com/glfw/glfw
    Cross platform Window & input wrapper
    great for opengl and vulkan
    
SDL - http://www.libsdl.org/
    Cross platform window, input, and sound manager
    supports directX, opengl, and vulkan 

SFML - https://github.com/SFML/SFML
    Great 2D focused library that supports visuals, audio, and networking
    Its a step above sdl & glfw, but not too much
    Also can be used to setup opengl for 3d contexts

glm - https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html
    OpenGL math library
    Based on GLSL syntax. 

ImGUI - https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
    debug gui library
    super easy to setup and use
    great for developers and tools
    includes code for integrating into most graphics API's

boost.ASIO - https://think-async.com
    networking library that is asynchronous and low level 

Assimp - https://github.com/assimp/assimp
    Loads many 3D model formats

tinyobjloader - https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader
    OBJ file format loader
    simple & easy to use

Bullet - https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3
    3D physics engine

PhysX - https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX-3.4
    3D physics engine by Nvidia
    
Box2D - https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D
    2D physics engine


-- Collections --
Boost - https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/libs/libraries.htm
    Easily one of the most respectible colletion of C++ libraries out there
    Has lots of large scale facilities, like networking and concurrency
    Keep in mind, many of the libraries have wound their way into the standard.
    Some are header files, while the big ones will require more setup to use

stb - https://github.com/nothings/stb
    bag of game dev goodies
    used all over the place.
    all header files so they are easy to implement & use
